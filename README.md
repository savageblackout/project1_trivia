#Misandry...The Trivia Game!

How much do you really know about misandry? 

Test your knowledge with this trivia game! 

You will be asked a series of multiple choice & true/false questions about all things misandry, after which point you will receive your score- what category do you fall into;

Are you a full-on FemiNazi? An honorary Mens Right Activist? Or perhaps a female chauvanist?

Test your knowledge with this slick trivia application and brag to your friends about how much you know about the manifestation of man hate! :-)

#Design Approach
---
The design for Misandry..The Trivia Game! is heavily influenced by this t-shirt, which I recieved as a birthday gift from a dear friend: 

![a tishirt with a big pink heart on the front with 'Misandry' printed inside of it](file:///Users/claire/code/Project01_MisandryTrivia/assets/tee%20logo.jpg)

The font on this shirt reminds me of one of my favorite childhood toys; more specifically, it brings to mind the font used for the Barbie brand:

The color pallet and font informed all of the design choices; from the background art, to the font color, to the logo design.
