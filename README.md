###Do you have no idea what misandry is? **_FOR SHAME!_**  Perhaps you'd like to bone up on your misandry knowledge. Whatever the reason, test your knowledge with this misandry trivia game!  

Be the delight of every dinner party as you dazzle guests with your deep and intimate knowledge of the hatred of males; which Mens Rights Activists (MRAs) purport is a characteristic of every feminist, all females who don't succumb to attempts at seduction, and Western society at large.

##How does it all work?!

You will be asked a series of multiple choice questions about all things misandry, after which point you will receive your score- what category do you fall into;

- Are you a full-on FemiNazi? 
- An Official Mens Right Activist? 
- Or perhaps a Female Chauvanist?

#Design Approach
---
The design for Misandry..The Trivia Game! is heavily influenced by this t-shirt, which I recieved as a birthday gift from a dear friend: 

![a tishirt with a big pink heart on the front with 'Misandry' printed inside of it](file:///Users/claire/code/Project01_MisandryTrivia/assets/barbie_stuff/tee%20logo.jpg)

The font on this shirt reminds me of one of my favorite childhood toys; more specifically, it brings to mind the font used for the Barbie brand:

The color pallet and font informed all of the design choices; from the background art, to the font color, to the logo design.

The use of memes and gifs is a reflection of my insterests and sense of humor. Who doesnt like a good 'Deal With It Dog', amirite?
